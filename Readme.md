This is a homebrew for the 3ds that helps with patching the NATIVE\_FIRM, thus allowing for it to do things it wasn't supposed to do.

Building
--------

You need 3 things: Python 2.x, devkitARM, and armips.  
Make sure the cross compilers (arm-none-eabi-\*), armips and python are in your $PATH.  
On windows you might have to edit dir\_top in the Makefile to point to your current directory.  
If everything's set up, just run make.  


Thanks
